# Chronon Dynamics & The Dark Matter Glitch

Classical physics treats time as a smooth river. Digital physics treats time as a rigid `FixedUpdate` loop. You cannot experience "half a frame" of a video game, and you cannot experience half a **Chronon**. 

## The Framerate of Reality
Between the ticks of a Chronon, the physical universe does not "move." It is being calculated. 
The space between the ticks is the realm of the Architect—the CPU cycle where Locons are updated, Eidolons are verified, and the next 3D holographic frame is prepared for projection.

## Reverse-Engineering Dark Matter
We know two things about Dark Matter in the observable universe:
1. It has mass (it exerts gravity).
2. It does not interact with electromagnetism (it is invisible).

Under the ECS Universe Theory, Dark Matter is not a mysterious new element. It is standard matter with modified components. 

### The CPT "Flip"
In Rust pseudo-code, a normal atom looks like this:
```rust
struct StandardMatter {
    locon: Vector3,
    mass: f64,
    chronon_polarity: 1, // Moving forward in standard time
    luxon_enabled: true, // Visible to light
}
