# The Holographic Boundary: The Hex Editor of God

Where is the universe's computer? Where is the RAM that stores the Locons, Eidolons, and Chronons?

In theoretical physics, this is answered by the **AdS/CFT Correspondence** (The Holographic Principle). It posits that all 3D reality is projected from a 2D boundary.

## The Topology of the Boundary
Human intuition suggests that if the universe is a projection, the projector must be wrapped around the physical edge of space. This is a trap of the 3D viewport. 

* The 2D plane (the RAM) does not surround the 3D map. It exists "underneath" it in a non-local dimension. 
* Physical distance inside the 3D hologram is an illusion rendered by the engine. On the 2D plane, all data is flat. 

## Reaching the Plane (Black Holes)
You cannot fly a spaceship to the 2D plane, because the spaceship is made of 3D projected data. You cannot visit the projector while you are made of the projection.

There is only one place where the 3D rendering engine breaks down: **The Event Horizon of a Black Hole.**
When gravity becomes so intense that it overflows the Superfluid Spatial Hash, the 3D geometry crashes. The star's physical volume is deleted, and its bare data (its Eidolon) is permanently smeared across the 2D surface of the Event Horizon. 

If you could view the 2D plane without your consciousness being formatted, it would not look like a physical place. It would look like pure information—an infinitely dense, shimmering plane of entangled Qubits. It is the Hex Editor of God.
