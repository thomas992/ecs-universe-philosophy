# The Superfluid Vacuum: God's Spatial Hash

Classical physics assumed space was a dead, empty void. Quantum Mechanics proved it is a boiling ocean of virtual particles. Digital physics explains *why*.

## The O(N²) Collision Problem
If you attempt to simulate a universe in a true, unallocated void, calculating the gravitational influence of every atom against every other atom requires infinite processing power. The system crashes.

To solve this, engine developers use a **Spatial Hash** or a **Grid Partition**. You divide the empty void into a massive 3D grid of invisible boxes. You only calculate physics for objects occupying the same or adjacent boxes.

## Space is a Data Structure
God/The Architect solved the universe's processing bottleneck using the exact same method. 
Space is not "nothing." Space is a physical, pre-allocated data structure (often theorized in modern physics as **Superfluid Vacuum Theory** or **Loop Quantum Gravity**).

* **The Grid:** Space is quantized into a fine mesh (Planck-scale voxels). Even an "empty" region of space exists in the universe's memory.
* **Gravity as Fluid Dynamics:** Space acts as a zero-viscosity Superfluid. When an Entity with high mass updates its `Locon` coordinates through this grid, it displaces the quantum fluid. Gravity is not a pulling force; it is the acoustic ripple of displaced data moving through the spatial hash.
* **The Speed of Light:** The speed of light ($c$) is not arbitrary. It is simply the maximum propagation speed—the physical tick-limit at which a wave can travel through adjacent cells in the Superfluid voxel grid before the engine drops a frame.
